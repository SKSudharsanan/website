# My Journey to Software Engineering

## The Two Choices

In my family, like many others in South India, you could only be two things: a doctor or an engineer. I wanted to be a doctor, so I studied biology and maths in school. I always liked to help people who were hurt, and I wasn't scared of blood or the trouble that comes with accidents. I tried to help in this way a few times, and it made me want to be an emergency surgeon to save lives. But I wasn't the best student, so becoming a doctor stayed just a dream.

## A Different Dream

I also loved movies and music since I was a kid and thought about working in that field. But that's a common dream where I come from. Most boys want to be movie stars or cricket players.

## What My Parents Wanted

My parents were pretty strict. They wanted me to have a big title like doctor or engineer. Since I couldn't become a doctor, they said I had to study engineering.

## Starting College

I didn't like engineering at all when I started college. I didn't know anything about computers or how to code. I felt like it wasn't for me and thought about quitting many times.

## Coding Felt Right

But then, coding just clicked for me. I could understand it and do it well without knowing much before. Maybe this was what I was meant to do. Making websites got me really excited and led to a new path for me.

## Creating My First Website

With my friends Neel and Balaji, we made a website called 'Chennaism.' It was about Chennai, the big city in Tamil Nadu. In our third year of college, we even got to make a feedback system for students using PHP.

## Making It Through College

I started to do well in design competitions at college, and that helped me pay for things because my dad had moved to a new city for his job.

## Coding Became My Thing

Before I finished college, coding was a big part of my life. My friends and I decided to do our final year project by ourselves. We didn't want to do the same AI projects as everyone else.

## Discovering Blockchain

We didn't even have a title for our project when we started. We were looking for something special. Then we found out about blockchain from a former student of our college who was in Japan.

There wasn't much information on blockchain, but we really wanted to make our own. We followed a video by a YouTuber named Ivan on Tech and made a basic blockchain with Python.

## Our Big Project

Our teacher didn't like our first project, so we had to start over. We went to meetups to learn about Ethereum and made a simple website like eBay but using blockchain.

It was tough to set up because of bad internet and a slow laptop, but we managed to make a sample online store using blockchain.

## My Start in Blockchain

That project helped me get my first job as a blockchain developer. I'll share more about that in my next blog.

Stay tuned for the rest of my story into tech.
